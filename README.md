# SetTerm

### About

Script for setting the terminal. The script currently does the following things:

- Create & write `.bashrc`
- Create & write `.vimrc`
- Install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

Currently the `...rc` files are designed according to my taste, so if you want to use this script you have to customize it.

### How to run

- Install the recent version of Python.
- Run `Run.py`.

### Warning

- Don't run this script in `sudo` mode!
  - In `sudo` mode python doesn't convert `~` (home directory) to the expected result.
